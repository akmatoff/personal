Hello, I'm Azim, a web-developer based in Kyrgyzstan.

With over 2 years of experience in web development, I specialize in React and Next.js.

I have been studying programming since 2018, before I went to
              college. By that time, I had started learning JavaScript, having
              previously learned HTML and CSS. I realized I needed JavaScript to
              advance, but I initially found it quite difficult to understand.
              My understanding of programming improved later when I studied
              Python at college.

I started my first job when I was almost 19, in February 2022. I
              joined a startup based in Singapore as an intern, where I worked
              for 2 years. During that time, I gained a lot of valuable
              experience.

Currently, I am looking for new opportunities and trying to keep
              improving.

When I&apos;m not programming, I&apos;m producing electronic music
              in various genres and also love playing the guitar.
